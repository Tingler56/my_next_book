# next_book


## Problem Statement

Have you ever finished reading an awesome book or even full series and think, what now? Well, the Next_Book App will recommend new books for you. By filling out a profile with books previously read, favorite authors, and genres you like; the Next_Book App can find a book to suit your tastes.

Using Amazon's Machine Learning API, the recommendations will be based on your preferences only.


### Project Technologies

1. Security 
    - There will be a login/password combination for each account

2. Database
    - MySQL database probably with Hibernate or another ORM

3. Machine Learning API
    - Most likely Amazon's API, but not for sure - Azure and IBM's Watson also look good

4. Web Scrapper
    - For training to Machine Learning utility as well as populating the databases with sufficient books for easy look up

5. Site will most likely be hosted on AWS
    
6. Unit testing
    - For the web scrapper I think 90% or above code coverage will be necessary
    - For the Machine Learning retrieval and use, I hope for a similar score but would settle for 80%
    - For the final recommendation and UI design, I expect 95% or above on code coverage

7. Logging will be done using Log4j
